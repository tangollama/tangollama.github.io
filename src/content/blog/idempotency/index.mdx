First, rather than bury the lead. I'll get to the point.

I'm exiting [New Relic](http://opensource.newrelic.com) this month and joining the Developer Products team at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api). If you're surprised by that news, I assure you that you're not as surprised as [January 2020 Joel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms7capx4Cb8) would have been to read it. Thus, the start of 2021 marks a season of change.

And as I'm entering and navigating a new season of transition, I've been thinking about a concept: _idempotency_.

If you're not familiar with the **idempotency**, it describes the ability to execute something multiple times without impacting the intended outcome. Something that is idempotent produces a consistent and reliable result. In math, **multiplying by 0** is an idempotent operation. In everyday life, elevator call buttons or crosswalks are idempotent. Once you push the button or call the operation, the procedure is going to execute (_pushing the button multiple times doesn't make it go faster_), and it's going to deliver the same thing.

The work I've been engaged in most recently at New Relic (_you'll soon see it in action by [signing up for a free account](https://newrelic.com/signup)_) has brought the concept into focus, as my team has been creating a consistent, simple, open installation architecture for New Relic One centered on our [open source CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli) and an [open library of installation tasks](https://github.com/newrelic/open-install-library/tree/main/docs) tied into the [platform GraphQL service](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql?#query=%7B%0A%20%20docs%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20openInstallation%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20recipeSearch%28criteria%3A%20%7BinstallTarget%3A%20%7Bos%3A%20LINUX%2C%20platform%3A%20AMAZON%7D%7D%29%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20count%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20results%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20displayName%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20description%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20repository%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A). Consequently, there's been a lot of team talk about executing a _thing_ multiple times and seeing a reliable result.

In that way, the work we've been producing has been a proxy for the character of the team.

## Great Teams

Over the course of my life and career, I've had the privilege of being a part of some great teams: groups of diverse people with equally diverse gifts and skills that have delivered some remarkable results in nonprofit, technology, and even volunteer settings. They often achieve more than their numbers suggest, and they've tended to operate in a kind of unity that is seemingly rare, yet welcome and familiar to those that seek and find it.

That's certainly true of the Open Source Engineering team at New Relic I'm leaving behind.

Perhaps the most remarkable characteristic has been how consistent and reliably these teams have operated. Give us a problem and we're going to solve it. Period. In that way, they've been... _idempotent_. :)

### A Reliable Response

That realization has me reflecting a bit on what makes that _quality_ possible and how best to foster and replicate it. I can point to some key ingredients like a culture of mentored leadership, trust and autonomy, an emphasis on influence vs. authority, and shared vision; but what I keep coming back to is simply _gratitude_ for so many remarkable co-workers who've made those consistent and reliable outcomes possible.

I try to live my life within a [worldview](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1ti.6.6-8) that recognizes everything good that comes to me as a gift received from a [generous host](https://bibleproject.com/explore/video/generosity/), and that certainly includes relationships. Good colleagues are a blessing, and I've received the benison of partnering with many admirable people.

And it's those people, those gifts, which have occupied my thoughts of late and in particular how _idempotent_ I've found them to be - operating consistently and reliably. I'm sincerely grateful for so many capable, generous humans at [New Relic](https://newrelic.com) who've been a part of this chapter of my journey.

To each of you: **thank you.**

## So what's next?

<img src="../../imgs/stripe.png" style="padding-bottom:20px;max-width:350px" />

After almost 3 years at [New Relic](http://opensource.newrelic.com), I'm headed towards a new adventure with a new team and new challenges. I'm joining the Developer Products leadership team at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api), taking on some cross-organizational initiatives, and once again defining a job that was created to fit my unique (_hopefully useful_) skills and a remit of authority that will become evident in the year ahead. It's a path I've gotten used to navigating, and I'm excited and grateful to be invited to do it again in service to another remarkable [organization](https://stripe.com/docs) and [mission](https://stripe.com/about#:~:text=Our%20mission%20is%20to%20increase,and%20manage%20their%20businesses%20online.).

My hope and intention is to lead well, help build and support some great teams, deliver reliable results, try to invent something along the way, and - most importantly - make my best contribution to the restoration of the world around me.

But for now, I'm grateful for a moment to reflect on the path that's brought me here and the reliability of the people who've walked it with me.

Applied multiple times, I wouldn't wish for the result to change.
